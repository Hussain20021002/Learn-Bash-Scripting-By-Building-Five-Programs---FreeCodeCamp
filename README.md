# Learn-Bash-Scripting-By-Building-Five-Programs---FreeCodeCamp
This repository contains five small Bash programs created as part of a Bash scripting tutorial. Each program serves a different purpose and demonstrates various Bash scripting techniques.

Programs
->Questionnaire (questionnaire.sh):
A simple questionnaire script that prompts the user with three questions and prints the responses.

->Countdown Timer (countdown.sh):
A countdown timer script that takes a positive integer as an argument and counts down to zero, pausing for one second between each number.

->Bingo Number Generator (bingo.sh):
A script that generates a random bingo number between 1 and 75 and prints it along with the corresponding letter (B, I, N, G, or O).

->Fortune Teller (fortune.sh):
A fortune-telling script that prompts the user to ask a yes or no question and provides a random response from a predefined set of answers.

Five Program Runner (five.sh):
----------------------------------
A script that runs all the other four programs consecutively.

Usage
To run any of the programs, simply execute the corresponding .sh file in your terminal. For example:
./questionnaire.sh

To run all programs consecutively, execute the five.sh script:
./five.sh

Getting Started
These scripts can be used as examples to learn Bash scripting or as standalone tools for various purposes. Feel free to modify and customize them according to your needs.
